### Project: Online Poker Game

This project was made as part of the evaluation of Web Applications and Services (ASW), Degree in Information Technology.

The project consisted in developing a web app for users to play the version of poker Texas hold 'em. To do so our group used a LAMP approach with a MVC pattern applied using the CodeIgniter Framework. The app suports registration of users, creation of games and admin functionalities. Users have access to profile page, where they can complete their profile, dashboard for admistrating their games and joining new ones, and a game page. Admin users have access to an admin page with stats of all users and games.
